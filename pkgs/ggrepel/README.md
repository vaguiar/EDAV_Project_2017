`ggrepel` provides geoms for [ggplot2] to repel overlapping text labels.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = 'red') +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = rownames(mtcars))) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16)
```

Also, look at the help pages:

```r
?geom_text_repel
?geom_label_repel
```

## Installation

[directlabels]

> This package is an attempt to make direct labeling a reality in everyday
> statistical practice by making available a body of useful functions that
> make direct labeling of common plots easy to do with high-level plotting

[wordcloud]

> Pretty word clouds.

The `wordcloud` package implements a spiraling algorithm to prevent text
labels from overlapping each other.

[FField]

> Force field simulation of interaction of set of points. Very useful for
> placing text labels on graphs, such as scatterplots.

I found that functions in the `FField` package were not ideal for repelling
overlapping rectangles, so I wrote my own.

See [this gist][1] for examples of how to use the `wordcloud` and `FField`
packages with `ggplot2`.
