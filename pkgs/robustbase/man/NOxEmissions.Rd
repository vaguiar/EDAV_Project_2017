\title{NOx Air Pollution Data}
\description{
  A typical medium sized environmental data set with hourly measurements
  of \eqn{NOx} pollution content in the ambient air.
}
\usage{data(NOxEmissions)}
\format{
  A data frame with 8088 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{julday}}{day number, a factor with levels \code{373}
      \dots \code{730}, typically with 24 hourly measurements.}
    \item{\code{LNOx}}{\eqn{\log} of hourly mean of NOx concentration in
      ambient air [ppb] next to a highly frequented motorway.}
    \item{\code{LNOxEm}}{\eqn{\log} of hourly sum of NOx emission of
      cars on this motorway in arbitrary units.}
    \item{\code{sqrtWS}}{Square root of wind speed [m/s].}
  }
}
\details{
  The original data set had more observations, but with missing values.
  Here, all cases with missing values were omitted
  (\code{\link{na.omit}(.)}), and then only those were retained that
  belonged to days with at least 20 (fully) observed hourly
  measurements.
