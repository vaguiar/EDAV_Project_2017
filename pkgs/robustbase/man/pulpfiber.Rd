  \emph{The dataset contains measurements of properties of pulp fibers and the
    paper made from them.  The aim is to investigate relations between pulp
    fiber properties and the resulting paper properties.  The dataset
    contains \eqn{n = 62} measurements of the following four pulp fiber
    characteristics: arithmetic fiber length, long fiber fraction, fine
    fiber fraction, and zero span tensile.  The four paper properties that
    have been measured are breaking length, elastic modulus, stress at
    failure, and burst strength.}

  The goal is to predict the \eqn{q = 4} paper properties from the
  \eqn{p = 4} fiber characteristics.
