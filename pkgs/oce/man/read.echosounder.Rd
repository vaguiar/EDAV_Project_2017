\title{Read an Echosounder File}
\usage{
read.echosounder(file, channel = 1, soundSpeed = swSoundSpeed(35, 10, 50),
  tz = getOption("oceTz"), debug = getOption("oceDebug"), processingLog)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a connection or a character string giving the name of the file
to load.}

\item{channel}{sequence number of channel to extract, for multi-channel
files.}

\item{soundSpeed}{sound speed, in m/s.  (The documents on Biosonics
instruments suggest that this could be inferred from values in the file
header, but test files proved this to be false.)}

\item{tz}{character string indicating time zone to be assumed in the data.}

\item{debug}{a flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 1 to get a moderate
amount of debugging information, or to 2 to get more.}

\item{processingLog}{if provided, the action item to be stored in the log,
typically only provided for internal calls.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\link[base]{class}} \code{"echosounder"} with
standard slots \code{metadata}, \code{data} and \code{processingLog} that
are described in the documentation for the object
\code{\link{echosounder-class}}.
}
\description{
Reads a biosonics echosounder file.  This function was written for and
tested with single-beam, dual-beam, and split-beam Biosonics files of type
V3, and may not work properly with other file formats.
}
\section{Bugs}{
 Only the amplitude information (in counts) is determined.  A
future version of this funciton may provide conversion to dB, etc.  The
handling of dual-beam and split-beam files is limited.  In the dual-beam
cse, only the wide beam signal is processed (I think ... it could be the
narrow beam, actually, given the confusing endian tricks being played).  In
the split-beam case, only amplitude is read, with the x-axis and y-axis
angle data being ignored.
