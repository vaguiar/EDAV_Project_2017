\title{Fit a Tidem (Tidal Model) to a Timeseries}
\usage{
tidem(t, x, constituents, latitude = NULL, rc = 1, regress = lm,
  debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Either a \code{sealevel} object (e.g. produced by
\code{\link{read.sealevel}} or \code{\link{as.sealevel}}) or a vector of
times. In the former case, time is part of the object, so \code{t} may not
be given here.  In the latter case, \code{tidem} needs a way to determine
time, so \code{t} must be given.}

\item{x}{an optional numerical vector holding something that varies with
time.  This is ignored if \code{t} is a \code{\link{sealevel-class}} object,
in which case it is inferred as \code{t[["elevation"]]}.}

\item{constituents}{an optional list of tidal constituents to which the fit
is done (see \dQuote{Details}.)}

\item{latitude}{if provided, the latitude of the observations.  If not
provided, \code{tidem} will try to infer this from \code{sl}.}

\item{rc}{the value of the coefficient in the Rayleigh criterion.}

\item{regress}{function to be used for regression, by default
\code{\link{lm}}, but could be for example \code{rlm} from the
\code{MASS} package.}

\item{debug}{an integer specifying whether debugging information is
to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
is used by many \code{oce} functions. Generally, setting \code{debug=0}
turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
be printed. If one function calls another, it usually reduces the value of
\code{debug} first, so that a user can often obtain deeper debugging
by specifying higher \code{debug} values.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\link{tidem-class}}, consisting of
\item{const}{constituent number, e.g. 1 for \code{Z0}, 1 for \code{SA},
etc.} \item{model}{the regression model} \item{name}{a vector of constituent
names, in non-subscript format, e.g. "\code{M2}".} \item{frequency}{a vector
of constituent frequencies, in inverse hours.} \item{amplitude}{a vector of
fitted constituent amplitudes, in metres.} \item{phase}{a vector of fitted
constituent phase.  NOTE: The definition of phase is likely to change as
this function evolves.  For now, it is phase with respect to the first data
sample.} \item{p}{a vector containing a sort of p value for each
constituent.  This is calculated as the average of the p values for the
sine() and cosine() portions used in fitting; whether it makes any sense is
an open question.}
}
\description{
The fit is done in terms of sine and cosine components at the indicated
tidal frequencies, with the amplitude and phase being calculated from the
resultant coefficients on the sine and cosine terms.
}
\details{
The tidal constituents to be used in the analysis are specified as follows.

\enumerate{

\item Case 1. If \code{constituents} is not provided, then the constituent
list will be made up of the 69 constituents regarded by Foreman as standard.
These include astronomical frequencies and some shallow-water frequencies,
and are as follows: \code{c("Z0", "SA", "SSA", "MSM", "MM", "MSF", "MF",
"ALP1", "2Q1", "SIG1", "Q1", "RHO1", "O1", "TAU1", "BET1", "NO1", "CHI1",
"PI1", "P1", "S1", "K1", "PSI1", "PHI1", "THE1", "J1", "SO1", "OO1", "UPS1",
"OQ2", "EPS2", "2N2", "MU2", "N2", "NU2", "GAM2", "H1", "M2", "H2", "MKS2",
"LDA2", "L2", "T2", "S2", "R2", "K2", "MSN2", "ETA2", "MO3", "M3", "SO3",
"MK3", "SK3", "MN4", "M4", "SN4", "MS4", "MK4", "S4", "SK4", "2MK5", "2SK5",
"2MN6", "M6", "2MS6", "2MK6", "2SM6", "MSK6", "3MK7", "M8")}.

\item Case 2. If the first item in \code{constituents} is the string
\code{"standard"}, then a provisional list is set up as in Case 1, and then
the (optional) rest of the elements of \code{constituents} are examined, in
order.  Each of these constituents is based on the name of a tidal
constituent in the Foreman (1977) notation.  (To get the list, execute
\code{data(tidedata)} and then execute \code{cat(tideData$name)}.)  Each
named constituent is added to the existing list, if it is not already there.
But, if the constituent is preceeded by a minus sign, then it is removed
from the list (if it is already there).  Thus, for example,
\code{constituents=c("standard", "-M2", "ST32")} would remove the M2
constituent and add the ST32 constituent.

\item Case 3. If the first item is not \code{"standard"}, then the list of
constituents is processed as in Case 2, but without starting with the
standard list. As an example, \code{constituents=c("K1", "M2")} would fit
for just the K1 and M2 components. (It would be strange to use a minus sign
to remove items from the list, but the function allows that.)

In each of the above cases, the list is reordered in frequency prior to the
analysis, so that the results of \code{\link{summary,tidem-method}} will be in a
familiar form.

Once the constituent list is determined, \code{tidem} prunes the elements of
the list by using the Rayleigh criterion, according to which two
constituents of frequencies \eqn{f_1}{f1} and \eqn{f_2}{f2} cannot be
resolved unless the time series spans a time interval of at least
\eqn{rc/(f_1-f_2)}{rc/(f1-f2)}. The value \code{rc=1} yields nominal
resolution.

A specific example may be of help in understanding the removal of unresolvable
constitutents. For example, the \code{data(sealevel)} dataset is of length
6718 hours, and this is too short to resolve the full list of constituents,
with the conventional (and, really, necessary) limit of \code{rc=1}.
From Table 1 of [1], this timeseries is too short to resolve the 
\code{SA} constituent, so that \code{SA} will not be in the resultant.
Similarly, Table 2 of [1] dictates the removal of
\code{PI1}, \code{S1} and \code{PSI1} from the list. And, finally,
Table 3 of [1] dictates the removal of
\code{H1}, \code{H2}, \code{T2} and \code{R2}.  Also, since Table 3
of [1] indiates that \code{GAM2} gets subsumed into \code{H1},
and if \code{H1} is already being deleted in this test case, then
\code{GAM2} will also be deleted.

A list of constituent names is created by the following:
\preformatted{
data(tidedata)
print(tidedata$const$name)
}

\strong{The text should include discussion of the (not yet performed) nodal
correction treatment.}

\section{Bugs}{


\enumerate{
\item 1.This function is not fully developed yet, and both the
form of the call and the results of the calculation may change.

\item 2.Nodal correction is not done.

\item 3.The reported \code{p} value may make no sense at all, and it might be
removed in a future version of this function. Perhaps a significance level
should be presented, as in the software developed by both Foreman and
Pawlowicz.
