\title{Convert ecliptical to equatorial coordinate}
\usage{
eclipticalToEquatorial(lambda, beta, epsilon)
}
\arguments{
\item{lambda}{longitude, in degrees, or a data frame containing
\code{lambda}, \code{beta}, and \code{epsilon}, in which case the next to
arguments are ignored.}

\item{beta}{geocentric latitude, in degrees}

\item{epsilon}{obliquity of the ecliptic, in degrees}
}
\value{
A data frame containing columns \code{rightAscension} and
\code{declination} both in degrees.
}
\description{
Convert from ecliptical to equatorial coordinates, using
equations 8.3 and 8.4 of [1], or, equivalently,
equations 12.3 and 12.4 of [2].

The code is based on [1]; see help(moonAngle,"oce") for comments on
the differences in formulae found in [2].  Indeed, [2] is only cited
here in case readers want to check the ideas of the formulae; DK
has found that [2] is available to him via his university library
inter-library loan system, whereas he owns a copy of [1].
