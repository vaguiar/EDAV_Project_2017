\title{Draw a Stick Plot}
\usage{
plotSticks(x, y, u, v, yscale = 1, add = FALSE, length = 1/20,
  mgp = getOption("oceMgp"), mar = c(mgp[1] + 1, mgp[1] + 1, 1, 1 +
  par("cex")), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{x coordinates of stick origins.}

\item{y}{y coordinates of stick origins.  If not supplied, 0 will be used;
if length is less than that of x, the first number is repeated and the rest
are ignored.}

\item{u}{x component of stick length.}

\item{v}{y component of stick length.}

\item{yscale}{scale from u and v to y (see \dQuote{Details}).}

\item{add}{boolean, set \code{TRUE} to add to an existing plot.}

\item{length}{value to be provided to \code{\link{arrows}}; here, we set a
default that is smaller than normally used, because these plots tend to be
crowded in oceanographic applications.}

\item{mgp}{3-element numerical vector to use for \code{par(mgp)}, and also
for \code{par(mar)}, computed from this.  The default is tighter than the R
default, in order to use more space for the data and less for the axes.}

\item{mar}{value to be used with \code{\link{par}("mar")}.}

\item{\dots}{graphical parameters passed down to \code{\link{arrows}}.  It
is common, for example, to use smaller arrow heads than \code{\link{arrows}}
uses; see \dQuote{Examples}.}
}
\description{
The arrows are drawn with directions on the graph that match the directions
indicated by the \code{u} and \code{v} components. The arrow size is set
relative to the units of the \code{y} axis, according to the value of
\code{yscale}, which has the unit of \code{v} divided by the unit of
\code{y}.
The interpretation of diagrams produced by \code{plotSticks} can be
difficult, owing to overlap in the arrows.  For this reason, it It is often
a good idea to smooth \code{u} and \code{v} before using this function.
