\title{Read a Topo File}
\usage{
read.topo(file, debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Name of a file containing an ETOPO-format dataset. Three
types are permitted; see \dQuote{Details}.}

\item{debug}{an integer specifying whether debugging information is
to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
is used by many \code{oce} functions. Generally, setting \code{debug=0}
turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
be printed. If one function calls another, it usually reduces the value of
\code{debug} first, so that a user can often obtain deeper debugging
by specifying higher \code{debug} values.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{\link{topo-class}} that which has the following slots.
\item{\code{data}}{: a data frame containing \code{lat}, \code{lon}, and
  \code{z}}
\item{\code{metadata}}{: a list containing the source filename}
\item{\code{processingLog}}{: a log, in the standard \code{oce} format.}
}
\description{
Read a file that contains topographic data in the ETOPO dataset, as provided by
the NOAA website (see \code{\link{download.topo}} for a good server for such
files.
}
\details{
The three permitted file types are as follows: (1) an ascii type described
by NOAA as "?"; (2) a NetCDF format described by NOAA as "GMT NetCDF"
(recognized by the presence of a variable named \code{}), and
(3) another NetCDF format described by NOAA as "NetCDF" (recognized
by the presence of a variable called \code{}). Files in each of these formatss
can be downloaded with \code{\link{download.topo}}.
