\title{Trim Beginning and Ending of a CTD cast}
\usage{
ctdTrim(x, method, removeDepthInversions = FALSE, parameters = NULL,
  debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ctd} object, i.e. one inheriting from \code{\link{ctd-class}}.}

\item{method}{A string (or a vector of two strings) specifying the trimming method, or a function to
be used to determine data indices to keep.  If \code{method} is not provided, \code{"downcast"} is
assumed. See \dQuote{Details}.}

\item{removeDepthInversions}{Logical value indicating whether to remove any levels at which depth is
less than, or equal to, a depth above.  (This is needed if the object is to be assembled into a
section, unless \code{\link{ctdDecimate}} will be used, which will remove the inversions.}

\item{parameters}{A list whose elements depend on the method; see \dQuote{Details}.}

\item{debug}{an integer specifying whether debugging information is
to be printed during the processing. This is a general parameter that
is used by many \code{oce} functions. Generally, setting \code{debug=0}
turns off the printing, while higher values suggest that more information
be printed. If one function calls another, it usually reduces the value of
\code{debug} first, so that a user can often obtain deeper debugging
by specifying higher \code{debug} values.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\link{ctd-class}}, with data having been trimmed in some way.
}
\description{
Often in CTD profiling, the goal is to isolate only the downcast, discarding measurements made in
the air, in an equilibration phase in which the device is held below the water surface, and then the
upcast phase that follows the downcast.  This is handled reasonably well by \code{ctdTrim} with
\code{method="downcast"}, although it is almost always best to use \code{\link{plotScan}} to
investigate the data, and then use the \code{method="index"} or \code{method="scan"} method based on
visual inspection of the data.
}
\details{
\code{ctdTrim} begins by examining the pressure differences between subsequent samples. If
these are all of the same value, then the input \code{ctd} object is returned, unaltered.
This handles the case of pressure-binned data. However, if the pressure difference
varies, a variety of approaches are taken to trimming the dataset.

\itemize{
  \item{If \code{method[1]} is \code{"downcast"} then an attempt is made to keep only data for
  which the CTD is descending.  This is done in stages, with variants based on \code{method[2]}, if
  supplied.  \emph{Step 1.} The pressure data are despiked with a smooth() filter with method "3R".
  This removes wild spikes that arise from poor instrument connections, etc.  \emph{Step 2.} If no
  \code{parameters} are given, then any data with negative pressures are deleted.  If there is a
  parameter named \code{pmin}, then that pressure (in decibars) is used instead as the lower limit.
  This is a commonly-used setup, e.g.  \code{ctdTrim(ctd, parameters=list(pmin=1))} removes the top
  decibar (roughly 1m) from the data.  Specifying \code{pmin} is a simple way to remove near-surface
  data, such as a shallow equilibration phase, and if specified will cause \code{ctdTrim} to skip
  step 4 below.  \emph{Step 3.} The maximum pressure is determined, and data acquired subsequent to
  that point are deleted.  This removes the upcast and any subsequent data.  \emph{Step 4.} If the
  \code{pmin} parameter is not specified, an attempt is made to remove an initial equilibrium phase
  by a regression of pressure on scan number.  There are three variants to this, depending on the
  value of the second \code{method} element. If it is \code{"A"} (or not given), the procedure is to
  call \code{\link{nls}} to fit a piecewise linear model of pressure as a function of scan,
  in which pressure is
  constant for scan less than a critical value, and then linearly varying for with scan. This is
  meant to handle the common situation in which the CTD is held at roughly constant depth (typically
  a metre or so) to equilibrate, before it is lowered through the water column.
  Case \code{"B"} is the same,
  except that the pressure in the surface region is taken to be zero (this does not make
  much sense, but it might help in some cases). Note that, prior to early 2016, method \code{"B"} was
  called method \code{"C"}; the old \code{"B"} method was judged useless and was removed.}

\item{If \code{method="sbe"}, a method similar to that described
  in the SBE Data Processing manual is used to remove the "soak"
  period at the beginning of a cast (see Section 6 under subsection
  "Loop Edit"). The method is based on the soak procedure whereby
  the instrument sits at a fixed depth for a period of time, after
  which it is raised toward the surface before beginning the actual
  downcast. This enables equilibration of the sensors while still
  permitting reasonably good near-surface data. Parameters for the
  method can be passed using the \code{parameters} argument, which
  include \code{minSoak} (the minimum depth for the soak) and
  \code{maxSoak} the maximum depth of the soak. The method finds
  the minimum pressure prior to the \code{maxSoak} value being
  passed, each of which occuring after the scan in which the
  \code{minSoak} value was reached. For the method to work, the
  pre-cast pressure minimum must be less than the \code{minSoak}
  value. The default values of \code{minSoak} and \code{maxSoak}
  are 1 and 20 dbar, respectively.}

\item{If \code{method="index"} or \code{"scan"}, then each column of data is subsetted according to the
  value of \code{parameters}. If the latter is a logical vector of length matching data column
  length, then it is used directly for subsetting. If \code{parameters} is a numerical vector with
  two elements, then the index or scan values that lie between \code{parameters[1]}
  and \code{parameters[2]} (inclusive) are used for subsetting.  The
  two-element method is probably the most useful, with the values being determined by visual
  inspection of the results of \code{\link{plotScan}}. While this may take a minute or two, the
  analyst should bear in mind that a deep-water CTD profile might take 6 hours, corresponding to
  ship-time costs exceeding a week of salary.}

\item{If \code{method="range"} then data are selected based on the value of the column named
  \code{parameters$item}.  This may be by range or by critical value.  By range: select values
  between \code{parameters$from} (the lower limit) and \code{parameters$to} (the upper limit) By
  critical value: select if the named column exceeds the value.  For example, \code{ctd2 <-
    ctdTrim(ctd, "range", parameters=list(item="scan", from=5))} starts at scan number 5 and
  continues to the end, while
  \code{ctdTrim(ctd,"range",parameters=list(item="scan",from=5,to=100))} also starts at scan 5,
  but extends only to scan 100.}

\item{If \code{method} is a function, then it must return a vector of \code{\link{logical}}
  values, computed based on two arguments: \code{data} (a
  \code{\link{list}}), and \code{parameters} as supplied to \code{ctdTrim}.  Both
  \code{inferWaterDepth} and \code{removeInversions} are ignored in the function case. See
  \dQuote{Examples}.}
