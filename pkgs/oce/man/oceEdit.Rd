\title{Edit an Oce Object}
\usage{
oceEdit(x, item, value, action, reason = "", person = "",
  debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{oce} object.  The exact action of \code{oceEdit} depends
on the \code{\link{class}} of \code{x}; see \dQuote{Details}.}

\item{item}{if supplied, a character string naming an item in the object's
metadata (see \dQuote{Details}).}

\item{value}{new value for item, if both supplied.}

\item{action}{optional character string containing R code to carry out some
action on the object.}

\item{reason}{character string giving the reason for the change.}

\item{person}{character string giving the name of person making the change.}

\item{debug}{an integer that specifies a level of debugging, with 0 or less
indicating no debugging, and 1 or more indicating debugging.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\link[base]{class}} \code{"oce"}, altered
appropriately, and with a log item indicating the nature of the alteration.
}
\description{
Edit an element of an oce object, inserting a note in the processing
log of the returned object.
}
\details{
There are several ways to use this function.

1. If both an \code{item} and \code{value} are supplied, then the object's
metadata entry named \code{item} is updated to the supplied \code{value}.

2. If \code{item} and \code{value} are not supplied, then \code{action} must
be supplied.  This is a character string specifying some action to be
performed on the object, e.g. a manipulation of a column.  The action must
refer to the object as \code{x}; see Examples.

3. Applied to an \code{adv} object (i.e. data from an acoustic velocimeter),
\code{oceEdit} treats items named \code{heading}, \code{pitch}, \code{roll}
appropriately, depending on the type of \code{adv} instrument used.  (This
is necessary because different manufacturers produce different forms of
these items, i.e. Nortek reports them on a time base that is different from
the velocity reporting, while Sontek reports them on the same time base.)

In each case, a log entry is stored in the object, to document the change.
Indeed, this is the main benefit to using this function, instead of altering
the object directly.  The log entry will be most useful if it contains a
brief note on the \code{reason} for the change, and the name of the
\code{person} doing the work.
