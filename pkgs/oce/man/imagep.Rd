\arguments{
\item{x, y}{These have different meanings in different modes of operation.
\emph{Mode 1.} One
mode has them meaning the locations of coordinates along which values
matrix \code{z} are defined. In this case, both \code{x} and \code{y}
must be supplied and, within each, the values must be finite and
distinct; if values are out of order, they (and \code{z}) will be
transformed to put them in order.
ordered in a matching way).  \emph{Mode 2.}
If \code{z} is provided but not \code{x} and \code{y}, then the latter
are constructed to
indicate the indices of the matrix, in contrast
to the range of 0 to 1, as is the case for \code{\link{image}}.
\emph{Mode 3.} If
\code{x} is a list, its components \code{x$x} and \code{x$y} are used
for \code{x} and \code{y}, respectively. If the list has component
\code{z} this is used for \code{z}. (NOTE: these arguments are meant to
mimic those of \code{\link{image}}, which explains the same description
here.)  \emph{Mode 4.} There are also some special cases, e.g. if \code{x} is a
topographic object such as can be created with \code{\link{read.topo}}
or \code{\link{as.topo}}, then longitude and latitude are used for
axes, and topographic height is drawn.}

\item{z}{A matrix containing the values to be plotted (NAs are allowed). Note
that x can be used instead of z for convenience. (NOTE: these arguments
are meant to mimic those of \code{\link{image}}, which explains the same
description here.)}

\item{xlim, ylim}{Limits on x and y axes.}

\item{zlim}{If missing, the z scale is determined by the range of the data.
If provided, \code{zlim} may take several forms. First, it may be a pair
of numbers that specify the limits for the colour scale.  Second,
it could be the string \code{"histogram"}, to yield a flattened
histogram (i.e. to increase contrast). Third, it could be the
string \code{"symmetric"}, to yield limits that are symmetric
about zero, which can be helpful in drawing velocity fields,
for which a zero value has a particular meaning (in which case,
a good colour scheme might be \code{col=\link{oceColorsTwo}}).}

\item{zclip}{Logical, indicating whether to clip the colours to those
corresponding to \code{zlim}. This only works if \code{zlim} is
provided. Clipped regions will be coloured with \code{missingColor}.
Thus, clipping an image is somewhat analogous to clipping in an xy
plot, with clipped data being ignored, which in an image means to be be
coloured with \code{missingColor}.}

\item{flipy}{Logical, with \code{TRUE} indicating that the image
should be flipped top to bottom (e.g. to produce a profile image
for a downward-looking acoustic-doppler profile).}

\item{xlab, ylab, zlab}{Names for x axis, y axis, and the image values.}

\item{zlabPosition}{String indicating where to put the label for the z axis,
either at the top-right of the main image, or on the side, in the axis
for the palette.}

\item{decimate}{Controls whether the image will be decimated before plotting,
in three possible cases. \strong{Case 1.}
If \code{decimate=FALSE} then every grid cell in the matrix will
be represented by a pixel in the image. \strong{Case 2 (the default).}
If \code{decimate=TRUE}, then decimation will be done
in the horizontal or vertical direction (or both) if the length of the
corresponding edge of the \code{z} matrix exceeds 800. (This also creates
a warning message.) The decimation
factor is computed as the integet just below the ratio of \code{z} dimension
to 400. Thus, no decimation is done if the dimension is less than 800,
but if the dimension s between 800 and 1199, only every second grid
point is mapped to a pixel in the image.  \strong{Case 3.}
If \code{decimate} is an integer, then that \code{z} is subsampled
at \code{seq.int(1L, dim(z)[1], by=decimate)} (as is \code{x}), and
the same is done for the \code{y} direction. \strong{Case 4.} If
\code{decimate} is a vector of two integers, the first is used for
the first index of \code{z}, and the second is used for the second
index.}

\item{breaks}{The z values for breaks in the colour scheme.  If this is of
length 1, the value indicates the desired number of breaks, which is
supplied to \code{\link{pretty}}, in determining clean break points.}

\item{col}{Either a vector of colours corresponding to the breaks, of length
1 plus the number of breaks, or a function specifying colours,
e.g. \code{\link{oce.colorsJet}} for a rainbow.}

\item{colormap}{A colour map as created by \code{\link{colormap}}.  If
provided, then \code{colormap$breaks} and \code{colormap$col} take
precedence over the present arguments \code{breaks} and \code{col}.
(All of the other contents of \code{colormap} are ignored, though.)}

\item{labels}{Optional vector of labels for ticks on palette axis (must
correspond with \code{at}).}

\item{at}{Optional vector of positions for the \code{label}s.}

\item{drawContours}{Logical value indicating whether to draw contours on the
image, and palette, at the colour breaks.  Images with a great deal of
high-wavenumber variation look poor with contours.}

\item{drawPalette}{Indication of the type of palette to draw, if any.  If
\code{drawPalette=TRUE}, a palette is drawn at the right-hand side of the
main image.  If \code{drawPalette=FALSE}, no palette is drawn, and the
right-hand side of the plot has a thin margin.  If
\code{drawPalette="space"}, then no palette is drawn, but space is put in
the right-hand margin to occupy the region in which the palette would
have been drawn.  This last form is useful for producing stacked plots
with uniform left and right margins, but with palettes on only some of
the images.}

\item{drawTriangles}{Logical value indicating whether to draw
triangles on the top and bottom of the palette.  This is passed to
\code{\link{drawPalette}}.}

\item{tformat}{Optional argument passed to \code{\link{oce.plot.ts}}, for
plot types that call that function.  (See \code{\link{strptime}} for the
format used.)}

\item{drawTimeRange}{Logical, only used if the \code{x} axis is a
time.  If \code{TRUE}, then an indication of the time range of the
data (not the axis) is indicated at the top-left margin of the
graph.  This is useful because the labels on time axes only indicate
hours if the range is less than a day, etc.}

\item{filledContour}{Boolean value indicating whether to use filled
contours to plot the image.}

\item{missingColor}{A colour to be used to indicate missing data, or
\code{NULL} for transparent (to see this, try setting
\code{par("bg")<-"red"}).}

\item{mgp}{A 3-element numerical vector to use for \code{par(mgp)}, and
also for \code{par(mar)}, computed from this.  The default is
tighter than the R default, in order to use more space for the
data and less for the axes.}

\item{mar}{A 4-element Value to be used with \code{\link{par}("mar")}.  If not
given, a reasonable value is calculated based on whether \code{xlab} and
\code{ylab} are empty strings.}

\item{mai.palette}{Palette margin corrections (in inches), added to the
\code{mai} value used for the palette.  Use with care.}

\item{xaxs}{Character indicating whether image should extend to edge
of x axis (with value \code{"i"}) or not; see
\code{\link[graphics]{par}}("xaxs").}

\item{yaxs}{As \code{xaxs} but for y axis.}

\item{asp}{Aspect ratio of the plot, as for \code{\link{plot.default}}. If
\code{x} inherits from \code{\link{topo-class}} and \code{asp=NA} (the
default) then \code{asp} is redefined to be the reciprocal of the
mean latitude in \code{x}, as a way to reduce geographical distortion.
Otherwise, if \code{asp} is not \code{NA}, then it is used directly.}

\item{cex}{Size of labels on axes and palette; see \code{\link[graphics]{par}}("cex").}

\item{adorn}{(\strong{Defunct})
An \code{\link{expression}} or vector of expressions that contain
R code that is to be executed immediately after each panel of the plot.
If the number of expressions matches the number of panels, then the 
expressions are used for the corresponding panels; otherwise, the
expression list is extended to match the number of panels (i.e.
to obtain \code{length(which)} elements). Note that \code{adorn}
is a dangerous argument, because if the expressions contained
therein set up local storage, there is a chance of entirely
disrupting the plotting. \strong{For this reason, \code{adorn} was
marked as defunct in June 2016, and will be removed entirely 
after the July CRAN release.} Users with existing code that uses
\code{adorn} should simply plot the panels individually, and
use conventional R functions, e.g. \code{\link{lines}} etc.,
after each panel, to achieve the desired effect.  (See
\code{\link{oce-defunct}} for notes on other deprecated or
defunct \code{oce} features.)}

\item{axes}{Logical, set \code{TRUE} to get axes on the main image.}

\item{main}{Title for plot.}

\item{axisPalette}{Optional replacement function for \code{axis()}, passed to
\code{\link{drawPalette}}.}

\item{add}{Logical value indicating whether to add to an existing plot.
The default value, \code{FALSE} indicates that a new plot is to be created.
However, if \code{add} is \code{TRUE}, the idea is to add an image (but not
its palette or its axes) to an existing plot. Clearly, then, arguments
such \code{xlim} are to be ignored. Indeed, if \code{add=TRUE}, the only
arguments examined are \code{x} (which must be a vector; the mode of providing
a matrix or \code{oce} object does not work), \code{y}, \code{z},
\code{decimate}, plus either \code{colormap} or
both \code{breaks} and \code{col}.}

\item{debug}{A flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 1 to get a
moderate amount of debugging information, or to 2 to get more.}

\item{\dots}{Optional arguments passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
A list is silently returned, containing \code{xat} and \code{yat},
    values that can be used by \code{\link{oce.grid}} to add a grid to the
    plot.
}
\description{
Plot an image with a colour palette, in a way that does not conflict with
\code{\link{par}(mfrow)} or \code{\link{layout}}.  To plot just a palette,
e.g. to get an x-y plot with points coloured according to a palette, use
\code{\link{drawPalette}} and then draw the main diagram.
}
\details{
By default, creates an image with a colour palette to the right.  The effect is similar to
\code{\link{filled.contour}} except that with \code{imagep} it is possible to
set the \code{\link{layout}} outside the function, which enables the creation
of plots with many image-palette panels.  Note that the contour lines may not
coincide with the colour transitions, in the case of coarse images.

Note that this does not use \code{\link{layout}} or any of the other screen
splitting methods.  It simply manipulates margins, and draws two plots
together.  This lets users employ their favourite layout schemes.

NOTE: \code{imagep} is an analogue of \code{\link{image}}, and from that
it borrows a the convention that the number of rows in the matrix corresponds to
to \code{x} axis, not the \code{y} axis.  (Actually, \code{\link{image}} permits
the length of \code{x} to match either \code{nrow(z)} or \code{1+nrow(z)}, but
here only the first is permitted.)
